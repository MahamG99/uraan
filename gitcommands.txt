Clone in a new folder:

	git clone https://github.com/shahparkhan/slate.git

Run this before doing anything. It pulls from the master and makes ur files uptodate. (change main to master Ashir):

	git pull origin main

Create a branch to work on

	git checkout -b <branch_name>

After making changes, add all the files first

	git add .

Commit your changes

	git commit -m "add custom message related to commit here"

Push to master

	git push origin <branch_name>


NOTE: Whenever you start working:
	
	cd to your cloned directory
	pull to update files: git pull origin master/main (main for adnan/shahpar master for ashir)
